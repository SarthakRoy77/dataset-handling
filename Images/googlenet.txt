GoogLeNet (Inception V1) is a deep convolutional neural 
network architecture designed for efficient image 
classification. It introduces the Inception module, 
which performs multiple convolution operations (1x1, 3x3, 5x5)
in parallel, along with max pooling and concatenates their
outputs. The architecture is deep, yet optimized for speed and
performance, which makes it suitable for large-scale visual
recognition tasks. It brought forward innovative architectural 
choices such as 1×1 convolutions, global average pooling and
the Inception module, all aimed at improving depth and
computational efficiency.
