# Image Handling for Deep Learning in PyTorch

This repository contains example files demonstrating how to **handle images for deep learning using PyTorch**.  
It focuses on the essential steps required to work with image data efficiently in PyTorch-based workflows.

## 📌 What This Repository Covers

- Loading images using PyTorch and related libraries  
- Applying image transformations (resize, normalization, augmentation, etc.)  
- Creating custom `Dataset` classes  
- Using `DataLoader` for batching and shuffling  
- Preparing image data for training deep learning models  

All implementations are **PyTorch-only** and intended to be simple, clean, and beginner-friendly.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to help understand:
- How image data flows into a PyTorch model  
- Best practices for preprocessing images for deep learning  
- How PyTorch handles tensors, datasets, and loaders for vision tasks
